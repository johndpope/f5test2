.. _f5test2-synopsis:

Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
distributed message passing.  It is focused on real-time operation,
but supports scheduling as well.

Description
===========

F5test2 is a structured framework that makes testing of F5 products easier.
It introduces the following concepts:

- Interfaces: an abstract layer of interactions with different entities
- Commands: a set of Actions focused on one Interface, version agnostic.
- Macros: a complex set of Actions or Commands spanned across one or more 
		  Interfaces
